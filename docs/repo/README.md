# Repositories

A repository stores software packages on a remote server that are used for installing and updating on Linux systems. 

Any repository that is intended for RHEL or CentOS can be used in AlmaLinux. As a part of the project, besides AlmaLinux repositories, you may also use CentOS SIGs, EPEL, and the ELRepo Project repositories
 with the following instructions:

* [AlmaLinux](/repo/AlmaLinux) - AlmaLinux repositories.
* [CentOS SIG](/repo/CentOS) - CentOS SIG's repositories. 
* [Extras](/repo/Extras) - Extra repositories such as EPEL and the ELRepo Project.
