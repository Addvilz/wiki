# Contributing to the AlmaLinux project


## Help with reporting bugs and making fixes

To make AlmaLinux successful we need the close involvement of community members. 
We use our own bug tracking system to find, track, and fix bugs and ask AlmaLinux
users to help us by filling in bug-reports. You can track and discuss all bugs
on [bugs.almalinux.org](https://bugs.almalinux.org/).


## Improve the documentation

TBD
