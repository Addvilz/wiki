# Contributing to the AlmaLinux project


## Help with reporting bugs and making fixes

To make AlmaLinux successful we need the close involvement of community members. 
We use our own bug tracking system to find, track, and fix bugs and ask AlmaLinux
users to help us by filling in bug-reports. You can track and discuss all bugs
on [bugs.almalinux.org](https://bugs.almalinux.org/).


## Improve the documentation

There are two options to submit a documentation update pull-request:

* Follow the "Edit this page" link on a wiki page to open the GitHub
  embedded Markdown editor, edit the page and submit your changes for review.
* Fork the [repository](https://github.com/AlmaLinux/wiki), edit or create
  a page, commit your changes and create a pull-request as described in the
  GitHub [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).
