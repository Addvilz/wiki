# About the project

The ELevate project is about the migration from RHEL 7 derivatives to RHEL 8 derivatives. The [Leapp utility](https://leapp.readthedocs.io) and a few [patches](https://github.com/AlmaLinux/leapp-repository/commits/almalinux) to support migration from CentOS are used to perform the upgrade. 

Please be aware this is not the forked project, there will be a pull request to the [original repository](https://github.com/oamg/leapp-repository) as soon as everything is ready.

# Available migration paths 

There are several ways to perform upgrade these days. Here is the list to see which migration directions are available:

* CentOS 7 - AlmaLinux 8
* CentOS 7 - Rocky Linux 8
* CentOS 7 - Oracle Linux 8
* CentOS 7 - CentOS Stream 8

# How to migrate

Please, visit the [ELevate Quickstart Guide](/elevate/ELevate-quickstart-guide) to see the update steps.


# Package Evolution Service

The Leapp utility uses several configuration files. The biggest one is the package evolution data file *pes-events.json*. Weâ€™ve launched [Package Evolution Service](https://pes.almalinux.org) (PES) to allow collaboration on creating and improving this data. This service allows you to download, customize and submit new data sets for packages. Users and maintainers can both utilize the PES to help make migrations smooth and easy.

# How to Contribute 

ELevate is developed and built as a tool for the whole ecosystem, not just AlmaLinux. ELevate supports migrating to/from other distributions and is open for all to contribute to and enhance. You can find more information and FAQ about migration on [almalinux.org/elevate](https://almalinux.org/elevate), [Migration SIG](https://wiki.almalinux.org/sigs/Migration.html) and get any help or contribute on [AlmaLinux Chat on Mattermost](https://chat.almalinux.org).
