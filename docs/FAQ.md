# Frequently asked questions


### What is AlmaLinux?

AlmaLinux is a 1:1 binary compatible fork of RHEL.


### Can I do X, Y or Z with AlmaLinux?

If you can with RHEL, the answer is yes. If you could with CentOS up to now,
unless RHEL changes in a different direction, you can continue doing it.


### When will it be released?

We are currently aiming for an end of January/beginning of February release
date for the beta.


### Who is AlmaLinux for?

Anyone who currently relies on the CentOS stable release to achieve computing
objectives. Individuals and organizations that require an enterprise-grade,
Fedora-like distribution but who do not want to or cannot pay for a RHEL
license.


### Why did we call it AlmaLinux?

Alma means soul in Spanish and other Latin languages. Looking back, it is
easy to see that Linux is as popular and pervasive as it is thanks to the
efforts of a passionate, diverse developer community. This community is the
soul of Linux, and everyone that relies on a Linux distribution is indebted
to the efforts of the Linux community. That is why we called our new
distribution AlmaLinux.


### How is the community protected from future course changes?

We will involve the community right through the process, including in the
governing board. At all times, AlmaLinux will be free and open. The community
can pick the project at any time.


### Why should I rely on CloudLinux for a CentOS alternative?

Our core product, the CloudLinux OS, is a RHEL fork that has been in place
for over ten years. More than 4,000 companies including Dell, Liquid Web,
and 1&1 rely on the CloudLinux OS across more than 200,000 product
installations. CloudLinux has proven experience in creating and maintaining
a RHEL fork and have done so starting with RHEL release 5, right through to
release 8. AlmaLinux is an opportunity for us to channel our expertise in
RHEL into a Linux distribution that serves the broader community.
Furthermore, we are including the Linux community right from the inception
of AlmaLinux. Moving forward, community members will be on the governing
board for the AlmaLinux project and involved in key decisions too. Finally,
AlmaLinux will always be free and open source. The community can pick up
and continue to develop AlmaLinux at any time.


### I want to convert from CentOS to AlmaLinux. How do I do it?

We will provide a single command to swap repositories and keys once the Beta
is out.


### Can I really port an entire fleet of servers from CentOS to AlmaLinux with a single command?

As stated, AlmaLinux will be a 1:1 binary compatible fork of RHEL, which
means that your applications and services will remain compatible. For that
reason, you can rapidly migrate any number of servers with just one command.


### Until when will we support AlmaLinux?

CloudLinux has committed to supporting AlmaLinux until 2029, including stable
and thoroughly tested updates and security patches.
